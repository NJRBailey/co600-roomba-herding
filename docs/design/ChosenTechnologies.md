# Chosen Technologies

### Programming Language

We will be using Python as our main language for the project. Although we have little experience in Python, we all agreed that it would be an interesting language to learn. Furthermore we have worked with similar languages and therefore believe that it wouldn't be a hard language to familiarise ourselves with. 

After having a look at ROS tutorials, we noticed that they only provided information in either Python or C++. Because Python was dynamically-typed, we thought it would be a more straightforward language to use than C++.

### Version Control -> Github

The version control system we have agreed to use is GitHub. It implemenents all the standard features of Git such as the ability to commit, push and pull tasks. It also enables us to view the history of file revisions, giving us the ability to revert back to a specific point if a mistake has been made.

We are able to each create a branch for our own pieces of work which means that we do not have to wait for another member to finish editing their code before another member can start. Furthermore, we are able to identify any merge conflicts easier this way.

GitHub provides us with pull requests which is important for each member to review the work being pushed to the central repository. Reviewing work such as code will not only spot any mistakes but will also be a form of teaching how make a piece of code more efficient. 

### Task Management -> Trello

We have decided to use Trello as our project management system. Because we have planned to do an agile approach towards our project, we believe that Trello most suited that. 

1. Trello allows tasks to be assigned to certain members of the group quickly using tags, therefore we can easily identify which task is owned by who using the labels. 

2. We can give tasks time estimates by editing the coloured labels, giving us a clear view of any time-heavy tasks that needs to be done.

3. Trello is flexible in adding and editing lanes within the project. Because of this, we are able to edit our own lanes such as the 'Defined' tasks, those that are in progress, those that are completed and those that have been approved on Git after completing.

4. Using the label feature we can filter through which sprint we are working on.

5. To further define a task we can write notes in the description, attach files to assist the task, and also update everyone on the specific task's activity using the comments section.

### Progress Monitoring -> Excel

We will use Excel for creating charts to monitor our progress. The main chart used to achieve this is the Gantt chart which will be created and will be maintained throughout the project. Excel can easily generate large charts with the ability to create macros from scratch therefore would be very useful when it comes to representing data. 

### Document Editor -> Word or Markdown

We have planned to use Word for most of the documents we have to write. We all agreed that this would be the easiest way to write documents whilst making sure there are no spelling and grammar mistakes. It also allows us to customise our documents better. Word documents can also be easily uploaded to Git therefore makes it easy to review. Word is also available on most devices and operating systems therefore every member can access/edit documents from various devices and locations.

Further to this, we have also chosen Markdown as an alternative to writing documents. We believe that this will make it much easier to review documents via Git, and will also decrease the time spent in converting documents into the corpus we have to submit later on in the year.

### Source Code Editor -> Visual Studio Code

We have decided to use Visual Studio Code as our source code editor. It is a cross-platform editor which is beneficial for our project as some of us will be working with Linux. VS Code will be helpful in terms of debugging the code as we write it as we can utilise their linting extensions to do so. It can also be extended with plugins we may need for the project. 

In terms of ease of use, VS Code offers an explorer tab on the side which will make it easier for us to navigate through all our different files.

### Communication Platform -> Messenger

Facebook Messenger has been decided as the messaging platform for us to use as a group. The main reasons were that everyone had access to it (especially on different devices) and each member usually checks their own Messenger account frequently, making it easier and faster to communicate.

It can send and handle quite large files therefore if we need to transfer files quickly, this is an option we can use. Messenger also has an ability to keep track of files/pictures sent therefore we won't need to scroll through the chat history to find a specific file.
